# About

__AceChase__ is a Massive Multiplayer Couch Vehicular Combat Game. Hard facts:

* free and open source so Richard Stallman is proud of us
* up to 129 local players (technically your PC can handle 127 USB gamepads plus keyboard plus mouse (if not also connected via USB (then only 127 players, sorry)))
* runs in the browser (seems to run better in Chrome than in Firefox)
* sneaky thought inception during loading time that makes our gamers better people and the world a better place

Awesome, right? Wait til you see our

# Future Plans

### Other vehicles

buggies / tanks / ... and many more probably maybe
