# About

__AceDroids__ is a Massive Multiplayer Couch Vehicular Combat Game. Hard facts:

* free and open source so Richard Stallman is proud of us
* up to 129 local players (technically your PC can handle 127 USB gamepads plus keyboard plus mouse (if not also connected via USB (then only 127 players, sorry)))

Also, your feedback and your feature requests are much appreciated. We don't know how to do that properly on GitHub so please just create issues.

Ah yeah, almost forgot. If you want to play, check out the
