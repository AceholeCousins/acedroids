# About

__AceChase__ is a Massive Multiplayer Couch Vehicular Combat Game. Hard facts:

* free and open source so Richard Stallman is proud of us
* up to 129 local players (technically your PC can handle 127 USB gamepads plus keyboard plus mouse (if not also connected via USB (then only 127 players, sorry)))
* runs in the browser (seems to run better in Chrome than in Firefox)
* sneaky thought inception during loading time that makes our gamers better people and the world a better place

# Future Plans

This is the first version of the game. You can only play as hovercrafty gliders and only free-for-all deathmatch.

However, we want to add

### Other game modes

team deathmatch / race / capture the flag / Davids vs. Goliath / carball / super mean boss fights / a single player campaign (maybe even for the phone) / who knows what else

### Other vehicles

buggies / tanks / ... and many more probably maybe

### A shirtload of special weapons

mines / homing missiles / time warp / ram boost thing / wall-reflecting death ray / oh so many more!

### Crazy awesome music

in the spirit of the current music, just less midi-ish.

Thus, we need your
